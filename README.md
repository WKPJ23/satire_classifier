Classification problem: Determining use of satire in online article headlines

This sequence of classification algorithms will attempt to determine whether an article title was written by the satirical journalism & media company The Onion or was an article title posted on Reddit's /r/nottheonion, a sub-Reddit (or sub-forum) that posts articles from legitimate news sources that can be misconstrued as satirical out of context.
